# Community-Detection
Community Detection in Complex Networks.

Detect Communities in Complex Networks using Girvan Newman Algorithm based on Betweenness Measure and the Newman's Fast Greedy Algorithm for community detection using modularity.

We can run the Girvan Newman algorithm using the Main method as a driver in CapGraph.java

We can run the Newman's greedy algorithm by using Main method as a driver in FastNewmanImpl.java
